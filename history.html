            <h1>History</h1>
            <p class="body">Historically, the Vikings believed that even if a person was dead their body could reanimate and inflict harm on anybody around them. They believed draugr to be extremely violent once resurrected, so the Vikings took
                serious precautions to prevent the draugr from attacking. Straw was often put under the shroud and a pair of scissors would be placed inside of the chest of the corpse. The toes of the corpse would also be tied together so that after reanimating, the draugr wouldn't be able to move.
                <br>
                Funerals had to be carried out very carefully in order to avoid reanimation. When in the proess of transferring the corpse and coffin into the graveyard, the Vikings had to be extra careful about how they transported the corpse because they believed that the draugr would try to return
                the way it was carried out. Often, a hole would be made in the wall of the deceased's home for the corpse to be carried out of. After pushing the corpse through the hole, they would seal the hole back up so that the way which the draugr had came no longer existed. Finally, a powerful man would chant magic words to bind the corpse to the coffin.
                <br>
                Draugr are as old as vikings are, but the first notable dragur was Glamr, a powerful and vengeful ghost who is defeated in <em>Grettis saga</em>. He was said to have brought such havoc that many would faint at the sight of him. Grettir defeats Glamr, and Glamr curses him with "more evil force than most other ghosts". Glamr is one of the only named and notable draugr.
