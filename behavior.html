                The clearest indication that a corpse is a draugr is if it is not resting in a horizontal position. In most cases, the corpse is found sitting upright in the crypt, or even standing straight up.
                While some accounts are conflicting, it is generally believed that any evil person could become a draugr, with the majority of them being "evil or marginal people". While this is the case, draugr have been noted to have the ability 
                to infect other people, making it so that they will become draugr when they ultimately perish.

                Typically, draugr possess superhuman strength and have many of the same abilities they had in life, only enhanced. Beyond their strength, other physical traits and behaviors are up for debate and interpretation. Some accounts say that draugr are 
                capable of shape-shifting, specifically into a seal, a great flayed bull, a grey horse with a broken back and no ears or tail, or a cat that would sit upon a sleeping man's chest and slowly grow until the man suffocated.
                Draugr are particularly motivated by greed, but they tend to show a great bloodthirst which can't ever be quenched. Draugr are known to attack innocent people and livestock for no reason other than boredom. They are also known to give passerbys the "Evil Eye", a 
                legendary curse which is shrouded in mystery.
