            <p class="body">In old Norse, the term <em>draugr</em> is defined as "a ghost, spirit, or dead inhabitant of a cairn".<br>
            Despite being a spirit, draugr have physical bodies that possess superhuman strength even with their bodies being in a constant state of decay
        The draugr are creatures as old as norse folklore itself, and it is impossible to know exactly when the idea was first concieved. They are one of the more infamous creatures in Norse mythology,
        gaining many different interpretations of their behavior, appearance, origin, and abilities.
