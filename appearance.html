                Draugr have been described as "generally hideous to look at", as their bodies bear a necrotic black color and are constantly displaying the common signs of decomposition.
                Glamir, the most well known and famous draugr, was "black as hell and bloated to the size of a bull". This description of bloating leads many to believe the corporeal forms of the draugr are simply reanimated in 
                whatever state they perished in.
